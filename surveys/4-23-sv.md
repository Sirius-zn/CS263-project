# Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs). 

+  **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** is a deep-learning approach for generating graph embedding. It is an inductive learning that can work on different graphs, where most previous non-deep-learning works (e.g. random walks) are transductive that can only handle one specific graph.
+ GNN computation is challenging since it incorporates two distinctive types of operations (**graph aggregation** <ins>(sparse, highly irregular)</ins> and the **neural network** <ins>(dense, highly regular)</ins>). 
+ Existing graph-processing frameworks and deep-learning frameworks fail to provide computing support for GNN effectively.
+ Therefore, we propose a GNN Inference Optimizing Framework, named **GIOF**, that can Find the suitable GNN kernel (*Scatter-Gather*, *SpMM*), 
+ Refine the kernel, via compute and memory optimizations based on input graph and node properties Generate an “optimal” runtime schedule.
 
+ Graph Convolution Kernel. `Z = f(X, A) = softmax(A.ReLU(A.X.W^0).W^1)`, where `W0` and `W1` are learnable parameters. 
A is the adjacency matrix for an input graph, and it can be store in either dense or sparse (CSR) format.
